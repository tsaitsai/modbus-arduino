Modbus Library for Arduino
==========================

This library allows your Arduino to communicate via Modbus protocol. The Modbus is a master-slave protocol
used in industrial automation and can be used in other areas, such as home automation.

The Modbus generally uses serial RS-232 or RS-485 as physical layer (then called Modbus Serial) and
TCP/IP via Ethernet or WiFi (Modbus IP).

In the current version the library allows the Arduino operate as a slave, supporting Modbus Serial,
Modbus over IP (TCP) and Modbus over UDP. For more information about Modbus see:

* [Modbus on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modbus)
* [Modbus application protocol (v1.1b)](http://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Application_Protocol_V1_1b.pdf)
* [Modbus messaging implementation guide (v1.0b)](http://www.modbus.org/docs/Modbus_Messaging_Implementation_Guide_V1_0b.pdf)
* [Modbus UDP](http://jamod.sourceforge.net/kbase/modbus_udp.html)


About
-----

This library is an extension of [Andr√© Sarmento's library](https://github.com/andresarmento/modbus-arduino),
adding support for UDP and the Ethernet 2 shield. Thanks go to him and those who did prior work
in other similar libraries.


Features
--------

* Operates as a slave (master mode in development)
* Supports Modbus Serial (RS-232 or RS485), Modbus IP (TCP) and Modbus UDP
* Reply exception messages for all supported functions
* Modbus functions supported:
  * 0x01 - Read Coils
  * 0x02 - Read Input Status (Read Discrete Inputs)
  * 0x03 - Read Holding Registers
  * 0x04 - Read Input Registers
  * 0x05 - Write Single Coil
  * 0x06 - Write Single Register
  * 0x0F - Write Multiple Coils
  * 0x10 - Write Multiple Registers


**Notes:**

1. When using Modbus IP the transport protocol is TCP (port 502) and, by
   default, the connection is terminated to each transmitted message, that is,
   is not a keep-alive type connection. If you need a TCP keep-alive connection
   you have to remove comments of this line in ModbusIP.h header (or ModbusIP_*
   headers):

   ```cpp
   #define TCP_KEEP_ALIVE
   ```

2. The offsets for registers are 0-based. So be careful when setting your
   supervisory system or your testing software. For example, in ScadaBR
   (http://www.scadabr.com.br) offsets are 0-based, then, a register configured
   as 100 in the library is set to 100 in ScadaBR. On the other hand, in the
   CAS Modbus Scanner
   (http://www.chipkin.com/products/software/modbus-software/cas-modbus-scanner/)
   offsets are 1-based, so a register configured as 100 in library should be
   101 in this software.

3. Early in the library Modbus.h file there is an option to limit the operation
   to the functions of Holding Registers, saving space in the program memory.
   Just comment out the following line:
   ```cpp
   #define USE_HOLDING_REGISTERS_ONLY
   ```
   Thus, only the following functions are supported:
   * 0x03 - Read Holding Registers
   * 0x06 - Write Single Register
   * 0x10 - Write Multiple Registers

4. When using Modbus Serial is possible to choose between Hardware Serial
   (default) or Software Serial. In this case you must edit the ModbusSerial.h
   file and comment out the following line:
   ```cpp
   #define USE_SOFTWARE_SERIAL
   ```

   Now, You can build your main program putting all necessary includes:
   ```cpp
   #include <Modbus.h>
   #include <ModbusSerial.h>
   #include <SoftwareSerial.h>
   ```

   And in the `setup()` function:
   ```cpp
   SoftwareSerial myserial(2,3);
   mb.config(&myserial, 38400);   // mb.config(mb.config(&myserial, 38400, 4) for RS-485
   ```


Howto
-----

There are six classes corresponding to six headers that may be used:

* `Modbus` - Base Library
* `ModbusSerial` - Modbus Serial Library (RS-232 and RS-485)
* `ModbusIP` - Modbus IP Library (standard Ethernet Shield)
* `ModbusUDP` - Modbus UDP Library (standard Ethernet Shield)
* `ModbusIP2` - Modbus IP Library (standard Ethernet 2 Shield)
* `ModbusUDP2` - Modbus UDP Library (standard Ethernet 2 Shield)
* `ModbusIP_ENC28J60` - Modbus IP Library (for ENC28J60 chip)
* `ModbusIP_ESP8266AT` - Modbus IP Library (for ESP8266 chip with AT firmware)

To use Modbus with the ESP8266 without the Arduino, you can use the
[modbus-esp8266](http://www.github.com/andresarmento/modbus-esp8266) library instead.

When opting for Modbus Serial or Modbus IP you must include in your sketch the
corresponding header and the base library header, eg:

```cpp
#include <Modbus.h>
#include <ModbusSerial.h>
```

### Modbus Jargon

In this library was decided to use the terms used in Modbus to the methods
names, then is important clarify the names of register types:

| Register type        | Use as             | Access            | Library methods       |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Coil                 | Digital Output     | Read/Write        | addCoil(), Coil()     |
| Holding Register     | Analog Output      | Read/Write        | addHreg(), Hreg()     |
| Input Status         | Digital Input      | Read Only         | addIsts(), Ists()     |
| Input Register       | Analog Input       | Read Only         | addIreg(), Ireg()     |

**Notes**

1. _Input Status_ is sometimes called _Discrete Input_.
2. _Holding Register_ or just _Register_ is also used to store values in the slave.
3. Examples of use: A _Coil_ can be used to drive a lamp or LED. A _Holding
   Register_ to store a counter or drive a Servo Motor. A _Input Status_ can be
   used with a reed switch in a door sensor and a _Input Register_ with a
   temperature sensor.

### Modbus Serial

There are four examples that can be accessed from the Arduino interface, once
you have installed the library. Let's look at the example Lamp.ino (only the
parts concerning Modbus will be commented):

```cpp
#include <Modbus.h>
#include <ModbusSerial.h>
```
Inclusion of the necessary libraries.


```cpp
const int LAMP1_COIL = 100;
```
Sets the Modbus register to represent a lamp or LED. This value is the offset (0-based) to be placed in its supervisory or testing software.
Note that if your software uses offsets 1-based the set value there should be 101, for this example.


```cpp
ModbusSerial mb;
```
Create the mb instance (ModbusSerial) to be used.


```cpp
mb.config (&Serial, 38400, SERIAL_8N1);
mb.setSlaveId (10);
```
Sets the serial port and the slave Id. Note that the serial port is passed as
reference, which permits the use of other serial ports in other Arduino models.
The bitrate and byte format (8N1) is being set. If you are using RS-485 the
configuration of another pin to control transmission/reception is required.
This is done as follows:

```cpp
mb.config (& Serial, 38400, SERIAL_8N1, 2);
```
In this case, the pin 2 will be used to control TX/RX.


```cpp
mb.addCoil (LAMP1_COIL);
```
Adds the register type Coil (digital output) that will be responsible for
activating the LED or lamp and verify their status.  The library allows you to
set an initial value for the register:

```cpp
mb.addCoil (LAMP1_COIL, true);
```
In this case the register is added and set to true. If you use the first form the default value is false.


```cpp
mb.task ();
```
This method makes all magic, answering requests and changing the registers if
necessary, it should be called only once, early in the loop.


```cpp
digitalWrite (ledPin, mb.Coil (LAMP1_COIL));
```
Finally the value of `LAMP1_COIL` register is used to drive the lamp or LED.


In much the same way, the other examples show the use of other methods available in the library:

```cpp
void addCoil (offset word, bool value);
void addHreg (offset word, word value);
void addIsts (offset word, bool value);
void addIreg (offset word, word value);
```
Adds registers and configures initial value if specified.

```cpp
bool Coil (offset word, bool value);
bool Hreg (offset word, word value);
bool Ists (offset word, bool value);
bool IREG (offset word, word value);
```
Sets a value to the register.

```cpp
bool Coil (offset word);
Hreg word (word offset);
bool Ists (offset word);
IREG word (word offset);
```
Returns the value of a register.


### Modbus IP

There are four examples that can be accessed from the Arduino interface, once
you have installed the library.  Let's look at the example Switch.ino (only the
parts concerning Modbus will be commented):

```cpp
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Ethernet.h>
#include <Modbus.h>
#include <ModbusIP.h>
```
Inclusion of the necessary libraries.

```cpp
const int SWITCH_ISTS = 100;
```
Sets the Modbus register to represent the switch. This value is the offset (0-based) to be placed in its supervisory or testing software.
Note that if your software uses offsets 1-based the set value there should be 101, for this example.

```cpp
ModbusIP mb;
```
Create the mb instance (ModbusIP) to be used.


```cpp
mac byte [] = {0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF, 0xFE, 0xED};
ip byte [] = {192, 168, 1, 120};
mb.config (mac, ip);
```

Sets the Ethernet shield. The values of the MAC Address and the IP are passed
by the `config()` method.  The syntax is equal to Arduino Ethernet class, and
supports the following formats:

```cpp
void config (uint8_t * mac)
void config (uint8_t * mac, IPAddress ip)
void config (uint8_t * mac, IPAddress ip, IPAddress dns)
void config (uint8_t * mac, IPAddress ip, IPAddress dns, gateway IPAddress)
void config (uint8_t * mac, IPAddress ip, IPAddress dns, IPAddress gateway, subnet IPAddress)
```

Then we have:
```cpp
mb.addIsts (SWITCH_ISTS);
```
Adds the register type Input Status (digital input) that is responsible for
detecting if a switch is in state on or off.  The library allows you to set an
initial value for the register:

```cpp
mb.addIsts (SWITCH_ISTS, true);
```
In this case the register is added and set to true. If you use the first form
the default value is false.


```cpp
mb.task ();
```
This method makes all magic, answering requests and changing the registers if
necessary, it should be called only once, early in the loop.


```cpp
mb.Ists (SWITCH_ISTS, digitalRead (switchPin));
```
Finally the value of SWITCH_ISTS register changes as the state of the selected
digital input.


### Modbus UDP

Functions like Modbus IP, except you need to include `ModbusUDP.h` (instead of `ModbusIP.h`).


### Modbus IP2

Functions like Modbus IP, except you need to include `ModbusIP2.h` (instead of `ModbusIP.h`),
as well as `Ethernet2.h` (instead of `Ethernet.h`).


### Modbus UDP2

Functions like Modbus UDP, except you need to include `ModbusUDP2.h` (instead of `ModbusUDP.h`),
as well as `Ethernet2.h` (instead of `Ethernet.h`).


### Modbus IP(ENC28J60)

The Arduino standard Ethernet shield is based on chip WIZnet W5100, therefore the IDE comes
with this library installed. If you have a shield based on ENC28J60 from Microchip you must install
another Ethernet library. Among several available we chose EtherCard.

Download the EtherCard in https://github.com/jcw/ethercard and install it in your IDE.
Use the following includes in your sketches:

```cpp
#include <EtherCard.h>
#include <ModbusIP_ENC28J60.h>
#include <Modbus.h>
```
Done! The use of Modbus functions is identical to the ModbusIP library described above.

**Notes:**

1. EtherCard is configured to use the pins 10, 11, 12 and 13.
2. The voltage for shields based on ENC28J60 is generally 3.3V.
3. Another alternative is to use the ENC28J60 UIPEthernet library, available
   from https://github.com/ntruchsess/arduino_uip. This library was made so
   that mimics the same standard Ethernet library functions, whose work is done
   by Wiznet W5100 chip. As the ENC28J60 not have all the features of the other
   chip, the library UIPEthernet uses a lot of memory, as it has to do in
   software what in the shield Wiznet is made in hardware. If for some reason
   you need to use this library, just change the file ModbusIP.h and your
   sketches, replacing the lines:

   ```cpp
   #include <Ethernet.h>
   ```

   by

   ```cpp
   #include <UIPEthernet.h>
   ```

   Then, you can use the ModbusIP library (not the ModbusIP_ENC28J60).  In fact
   it allows any library or skecth, made for Wiznet shield be used in shield
   ENC28J60. The big problem with this approach (and why we chose EtherCard) is
   that UIPEthernet library + ModbusIP uses about 60% arduino program memory,
   whereas with Ethercard + ModbusIP_ENC28J60 this value drops to 30%!


### Modbus IP (ESP8266 AT)

Modules based on ESP8266 are quite successful and cheap. With firmware that
responds to AT commands (standard on many modules) you can use them as a
simple wireless network interface to the Arduino.

The firmware used in the module (at_v0.20_on_SDKv0.9.3) is available at:
http://www.electrodragon.com/w/ESP8266_AT-command_firmware

(Other AT firmwares compatible with ITEAD WeeESP8266 Library should work)

Warning: Firmware such as NodeMCU and MicroPython does not work because libraries
used here depend on a firmware that responds to AT commands via serial interface.
The firmware mentioned are used when you want to use ESP8266 modules without the Arduino.

You will need the WeeESP8266 library (ITEAD) for the Arduino. Download from:

https://github.com/itead/ITEADLIB_Arduino_WeeESP8266 and install in your IDE.

**Notes:**

1. The ESP8266 library can be used with a serial interface by hardware
   (HardwareSerial) or by software (SoftwareSerial). By default it will use
   HardwareSerial, to change edit the file ESP8266.h removing the comments from
   line:

   ```cpp
   #define ESP8266_USE_SOFTWARE_SERIAL
   ```

2. Remember that the power of ESP8266 module is 3.3V.


For Modbus IP (ESP8266 AT) there is four examples that can be accessed from the Arduino interface.
Let's look at the example Lamp.ino (only the parts concerning Modbus will be commented):

```cpp
#include <ESP8266.h>
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>
#include <Modbus.h>
#include <ModbusIP_ESP8266AT.h>
```
Inclusion of the necessary libraries.


```cpp
SoftwareSerial wifiSerial(2 , 3);
```
Creates the serial interface via software using pins 2 (RX) and 3 (TX). So it can use
hardware for the serial communication with the PC (e.g. for debugging purposes) in Arduino models that have only one serial (Ex .: Arduino UNO).


```cpp
ESP8266 wifi(wifiSerial, 9600);
```
Create the wifi object (ESP8266) specifying the rate in bps.  Warning: If you
use SoftwareSerial do not specify a baud rate of 115200bps or more for the
serial because it will not function. Some firmware / modules comes with
115200bps by default. You will have to change the module via AT command:
```
AT+CIOBAUD=9600
```

Continuing with our example:
```cpp
const int LAMP1_COIL = 100;
```
Sets the Modbus register to represent a lamp or LED. This value is the offset
(0-based) to be placed in its supervisory or testing software.  Note that if
your software uses offsets 1-based the set value there should be 101, for this
example.


```cpp
ModbusIP mb;
```
Create the mb instance (ModbusSerial) to be used.


```cpp
mb.config(wifi, "your_ssid", "your_password");
```
Configure ESP8266 module. The values quoted correspond to the network name
(SSID) and security key.  By default IP configuration is received via DHCP. See
the end of the section how to have an Static IP (important so you do not need
to change the master / supervisor if the IP changes).


Folowing, we have:
```cpp
mb.addCoil (LAMP1_COIL);
```
Adds the register type Coil (digital output) that will be responsible for
activating the LED or lamp and verify their status.  The library allows you to
set an initial value for the register:

```cpp
mb.addCoil (LAMP1_COIL, true);
```
In this case the register is added and set to true. If you use the first form the default value is false.


```cpp
mb.task();
```
This method makes all magic, answering requests and changing the registers if necessary, it should be called only once, early in the loop.


```cpp
digitalWrite(ledPin, mb.Coil(LAMP1_COIL));
```
Finally the value of `LAMP1_COIL` register is used to drive the lamp or LED.

Quite similarly to other examples show the use of other methods available in the library.


#### Using a static IP on the ESP8266 module

We are aware today of two options:

1. In your router configure the MAC address of the module so that the IP
   address provided by DHCP is always the same (Most routers have this
   feature).

2. In your code, include two lines to change the IP address after the module
   configuration:

   ```cpp
   mb.config(wifi, "your_ssid", "your_password");
   delay(1000);
   wifiSerial.println("AT+CIPSTA=\"192.168.1.44\"");
   ```

**Note:**

For the module to  receive IP via DHCP again you will need to remove the lines
and run (at least once) the command: AT + CWDHCP = 1.1 via direct connection to
the module, either:

```cpp
wifiSerial.println("AT+CWDHCP=1,1");
```
